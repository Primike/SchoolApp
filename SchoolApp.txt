Hello this app is currently undergoing restructuring and refactoring in order to meet MVVMC standards as well as creating cleaner reusable code. I am also working on pushing it to the App Store once the project is satisfactory 

This is an app that users can use to search up high schools

This app allows users to search schools by test scores

This app allows users to search by name or address

This app also implements Mapkit and allows users to search by location

This app allows users to save schools using user defaults

This app also has a saved copy of the api database incase there is no connection
