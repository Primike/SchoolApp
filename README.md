# SchoolApp

Hello this is a UIKit app that allows users to:

- Search schools and sort them by their test scores
- Displays useful school and exam information
- Allows schools to be added to users favorites
- Allows users to search by map



To the untrained eye perhaps this app is not as exciting, but I believe this app displays my creativity and passion for code structure and quality.

This app serves as a reference for many UIKit features/architecture I may need to refresh on or will forget.

I could have easily found some exciting crypto tutorial and copied it but I wanted to challenge my creativity. 
I only had some simple school data to play with and I made sure I did what I could to squeeze water from stone.
I have other ideas I can continue to add but it's time for me to move on to a much bigger app.
